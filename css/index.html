    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
       traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional 
       framework, such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a 
       structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails
       unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized 
       into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary
       education.The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims 
       of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical 
       thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education.
       Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, 
       equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it 
       stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. </p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India covers different levels and types of learning,
       such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and 
       vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location 
       (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.Education in India faces many 
       challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts,
       increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening
       governance and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19
       pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as 
       the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.</p>

    <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educate Together has its roots in the Dalkey School Project founded in 
      the 1970s.Before multi-denominational education, some of those involved in education in Ireland, 
      such as √Åine Hyland, Michael Johnston and Florrie Armstrong, questioned the denominational nature of the 
      system and the need to have students of different faiths in different schools.This group of educationalists 
      and parents established the organisation with the stated aim:"To develop and support in Ireland the establishment
       of schools which are multi-denominational (i.e. with equal right of access for the children of Catholic, 
       Protestant and other parents, and with the cultural and social background of each child held in equal 
       respect), co-educational and managed under a system which is predominantly democratic in character, wherever
        and whenever there is viable local support for such a school".
